# ECE1513 - Intro to Machine Learning

This repository contains solutions and assignments for the ECE1513 course, "Introduction to Machine Learning," taken at the University of Toronto. The course covers key concepts in machine learning, including supervised learning, regression, classification algorithms, and the application of various models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Repository Contents

### Files and Scripts:

- **Assignment5_CNN.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for Assignment 5, demonstrating the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- **arhamsheikh_ece1513_assingment3.py**: Python script for Assignment 3, focusing on Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Kernels.
- **ece1513_assignment_1.py**: Python script for Assignment 1, implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
- **ece1513assignment2.py**: Python script for Assignment 2, using Linear Regression and calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Setup and Installation

To run the scripts and notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb` files)
- Required Python libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`, etc.)
